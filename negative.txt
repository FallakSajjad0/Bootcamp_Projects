Despite its benefits, working from home can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
Without regular face-to-face interactions, communication with colleagues can become strained
or less effective. It can also blur the line between personal and professional life, making 
it hard to "switch off" after work hours. Many people struggle with distractions at home or
lack a dedicated workspace, which can hurt productivity and focus. In the long term, this 
setup may affect team collaboration and employee morale.
